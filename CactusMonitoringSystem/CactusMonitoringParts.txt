#Cactus Monitoring Device Parts


Cactus voltage: 26 AWG wire inserted into the chlorenchyma (layer with chloroplasts & photosynthetic activity site) of the light-facing stem side

Cactus current: 26 AWG wire with 2 ohm resistance connected to the cactus voltage wire

Cactus ground: 26 AWG wire inserted into the chlorenchyma (layer with chloroplasts & photosynthetic activity site) of the shaded stem side

pH: Atlas Scientific Mini Lab Grade pH probe attached to the EZO pH circuit inserted into the Isolated Carrier Board. The pH probes are embedded into each side of the stem's chlorenchyma

Light sensors: Custom designed PAR sensors by Ben Cooper (see PAR sensors)

Micro SD card holder: Micro SD Card Adapter Reader Module with SPI interface 

Real Time Clock: AITRIP DS3231 Real Time Clock module 

Microcontroller: Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2, connected to Google Sheets for real time data monitoring
